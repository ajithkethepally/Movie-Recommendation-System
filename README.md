# Movie-Recommendation-System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project! This system provides movie recommendations using a content-based approach and cosine similarity.

## Overview

- **Dataset & Jupyter Notebook Setup:**
  Set up the project with the TMDB dataset and Jupyter Notebook environment.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  Prepare the dataset for analysis and recommendation.

- **Vectorization:**
  Convert movie features into numerical vectors.

- **Main Function:**
  Implement the core recommendation logic using cosine similarity.

- **Frontend/Streamlit:**
  Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Prepare the dataset and set up the Jupyter Notebook environment.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and organize the data for analysis.

3. **Vectorization:**
   - Convert movie features into numerical vectors.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Implement the recommendation logic using cosine similarity.

5. **Frontend/Streamlit:**
   - Interact with the system through the user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Getting Started
